#Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.
# = operator is assignment operator
# It used for assigning value to a variable
num = 4
x = 19

# == operator it is one type of rational operator for equality comparison
#Relational operator are : <, >, ==, >=, <=, !=
# It sets to true if both operands are equal else false

name = "Tanuja"
name1 = "Rajpure"
print(name == name1)


#What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
# The ** operator is used for exponentiation
# It is a binary operator that takes two operands: the base and the exponent.

result = 2 ** 3  # 2 raised to the power of 3
print(result)  # Outputs 8

result = 5 ** 2  # 5 raised to the power of 2
print(result)  # Outputs 25

#What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?

# The ^ operator is a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator.
# It compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of its second operand.
# If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1.
# Otherwise, it is set to 0.

x = 10  # Binary: 1010
y = 4   # Binary: 0100
result = x ^ y  # Binary result: 1110
print(result)  # Outputs 14

# Binary breakdown:
# 1010
# 0100
# ----
# 1110 (which is 14 in decimal)
