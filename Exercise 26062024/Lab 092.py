# OOPS Concepts
# - > Object Oriented Programmings
# -> Object ? ->
# Attributes - > By which we can recognise object
# For e.g. Studens- Name, Id, No, City, Class, Division
# Behaviour- Activity which we do
# For e,g, talk, walk, smile, write


# Procedural programming language - Functions only- No relation with attributes and behaviour
# e.g C, Basic, Fortan,

# Languages close to real world
# e.g. C++, Python, Java, C#

# OOPS- Classes and Objects
#OOPs Defination- Is a programming paradigm that uses "Objects" to design applications
# and computer programms.

# Attributes / Properties / Data members
# Behaviour / Methods / members functions

# Class and Object ?

# CLASS_ A group of object which has common / similar properties
# Class is just a blueprint to create Object
# When classes created , no memory allocated
# All data members and member functions of the class can be accessed with the help of class
# Objects are allocated memory space whenever they are created

# Object are instance of class
